This is a timer using pomodoro technique.  
## How to use?
Go to `Pomodoro` tab, press start, work in 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, switch to `Short break` tab, press start and break in 5 minutes.

Keeping do that 4 times then switch to `Long break` tab for break in 10 minutes. Repeat until u're fucking tired =]

I suggest u should using standing desk to working. It really help pumping ur blood.
